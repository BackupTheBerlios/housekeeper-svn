    <section name="Housekeeper">
        <p> This project's goal is to provide a platform for managing all your 
            household issues. You will be able to keep overview of how much you 
            paid for food, what you have in stock, store your favourite recipes 
            in a central place and get alarmed about nutritional values you are 
            short of.</p>
        <p>Please see the <a href="roadmap.html">Roadmap</a> for planned 
            features.</p>
    </section>
    <section name="Prerequisites">
            <p>Housekeeper is compatible with every computer for which a Java 
            Runtime Environment (JRE) is available. This includes computers 
            running on Windows 95/98/ME/2000/XP, Macintosh OS X, Linux or 
            Solaris.</p>
            <p>You can download a JRE for free <a 
            href="http://javashoplm.sun.com/ECom/docs/Welcome.jsp?StoreId=22&amp;PartDetailId=jre-1.5.0-oth-JPR&amp;SiteId=JSC&amp;TransactionId=noreg">here</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
            If your operating system is Macintosh OS X or Linux you probably 
            already have such a JRE installed. Make sure your JRE's version is 
            at least 1.4</p>
