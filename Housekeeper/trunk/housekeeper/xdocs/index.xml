    <section name="About Housekeeper">
        <p> This project's goal is to provide an application for managing 
            household issues. Currently, it is able to keep a list of food 
            inlcuding their expiry dates so you always have an overview of what 
            is going to seed soon.</p>
        <p>Please see the <a 
          href="http://developer.berlios.de/feature/?group_id=3180">Requested 
          features tracker</a> for planned features. If you have an idea for an 
          additional feature please don't hesitate to create a new entry to the 
          tracker!</p>
