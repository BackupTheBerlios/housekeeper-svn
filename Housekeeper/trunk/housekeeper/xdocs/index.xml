    <section name="About Housekeeper">
      <p>Housekeeper is an application wich supports the management of a household.
        Currently, it helps keeping track of which items you have on hand (like
        food or medicaments).
        You can specify expiry dates and sort your items after 
        them so you always have an overview of what is going to seed soon.</p>
